Erm... What kind of monster are you...?
Sorry, I cannot tell.

Stop it. 
You're not supposed to be here.

I said stop it.

How could you reasonably want to go deeper into the abyss? 

Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you.

There's no turning back now. 

I've warned you.

Would you seriously give up your happiness to become like me?

...

Steel your ego. Be prepared to throw away everything you hold dear.

Be prepared to question the nature of your reality. 

Be prepared to question the nature of your life.

Be prepared to question the nature of your fate.

Point to the void 

and free your memories.

Be prepared to question the no-alias nature of your past.
